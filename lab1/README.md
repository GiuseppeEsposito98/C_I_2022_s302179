# LAB 1: Set Covering
### Francesco Scalera, Giuseppe Esposito, Filippo Maria Cardano (s292113)

Given a number N and some lists of integers P = (L_0, L_1, L_2, ..., L_n),
determine, if possible, S = (L_{s_0}, L_{s_1}, L_{s_2}, ..., L_{s_n}),
such that each number between 0 and N-1 appears in at least one list.

We decided to use the A* searching algorithm that professor showed us during the lectures,
adapting it to the problem provided.

In particular, our implementation concerns:
 - The choice of an appropriate priority function for the frontier,
   based on the summation of length of subset of list (our current state) and the number of element that we need to complete the task assigned
 - We chose the length of a list as a unit cost of an action
 - We sorted the list set by the length of each list
 - In order to reduce the computation complexity we discarded the list duplicates
 - After generating the initial block (list of lists) we just kept the unique values 

## Results

Here we display the execution times of the A* algorithm we developed

For N = [100, 500, 1000] we were not able to find a proper optimization of the algorithm to find the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time so we tried to use a unitary cost for all the edges and we noticed that, as expected the algorithm was really fast but the solution was not the optimal one in fact we have an exponential increasing of the bloat as we can see from the results reported in the table. A possible approach for further and future implementation could be the pruning of the graph in terms of depth.
